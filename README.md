# Odin_Business_website

After Completing the Flexbox lessons on TOP I have learned so many basic things of HTML and CSS. 
So im gonna apply those knowledge and try to build my wife's business website through the instructions of TOP .



i just finished to build the webpage as the instruction. Through this journey i understand that it is not gonna easy as i thought for me. i have me practice a lot to become a good developer. Also I need to understand concepts more.

my web site is not responsive. i looks very ugly at smaller screen . but i finished the task and wanna learn more and more and more.
